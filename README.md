## General Information

In the business of money lending, every customer is a potential source of income. However, a **defaulter** &mdash; *a borrower who fails to pay the amount owned* &mdash; is of big concern. Money lending is a risky business.

Through this analysis we're trying to find a pattern for defaulters as well as not-defaulters.  
It is critical to identify these patterns for the following reasons:
- approving a loan for a likely defaulter may lead to a **financial loss** for the company
- denying a loan to an applicant who's likely to repay the loan is a **loss of business** to the company

The data is provided by "a" consumer finance company. It has *the complete loan data for all loans issued from 2007 to 2011*. A data dictionary that describes the attributes is also provided.
